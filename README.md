# proof

This repository is a collection of proofs of various theorems presented as structured derivations using markdown and latex.

GitHub's markdown rendering is nice, but these proofs rely on indentation, which the renderer messes up.

I suggest viewing the markdown in a markdown editor.  The one I use is called Typora, and I love it ❤️
