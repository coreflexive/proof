# proof

This repository is a collection of proofs of various theorems presented as structured derivations.

I've written them in markdown which turns out to be easier than I thought it would be ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

You don't need to clone this repo or even download anything to view these proofs.  Just click on one of the markdown files and GitHub will render it for you.

Why don't you start with one of [my favourites so far ](https://github.com/coreflexive/proof/blob/main/Antisymmetric.Ex.Symmetric.md) which shows how a symmetric operator gives rise to an _antisymmetric_ relation.

Also, have a look at the files beginning with `Cohen`: they're derivations in the refinement calculus which is extremely cool.
